# Carbon-Removal-Analysis
# **Understanding CO₂ Contributions and Mitigation Strategies**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes carbon contributions, removal efforts, and the economic feasibility of large-scale carbon removal. It integrates real-world CO₂ data, visualizes emissions and removal trends, and evaluates the costs associated with different mitigation strategies.  

The goal is to provide a clear understanding of where we stand in terms of CO₂ emissions and what solutions might be the most practical for reducing the carbon gap.

## **Why This Project Matters**  
Climate change is driven by excess greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO₂), in the atmosphere. While industries and governments are making efforts to cut emissions, **active CO₂ removal** is still needed to meet global climate targets.  

This project aims to answer key questions:  
- How much CO₂ is still unaddressed?  
- How much progress has been made in CO₂ removal?  
- What are the most cost-effective removal strategies?  
- Can technology scale up fast enough to bridge the gap?  

By analyzing available data and running cost comparisons, this project provides insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers interested in carbon capture and removal.

## **How It Works**  

### **1. Fetching Real-Time CO₂ Data**  
The project pulls real-world atmospheric CO₂ concentration data from **NOAA's Mauna Loa Observatory API**, providing the latest CO₂ levels.  

### **2. Visualizing Carbon Contributions vs. Removal Needs**  
A **stacked bar chart** represents different sources of CO₂ emissions and removal efforts, highlighting the gap between them.  

### **3. Analyzing the Carbon Gap**  
By examining emissions, feedback loops, and current removal methods, the project identifies how much CO₂ still needs to be addressed.  

### **4. Evaluating Economic Feasibility**  
The cost-effectiveness of **Direct Air Capture (DAC) vs. Nature-Based Solutions** is analyzed, helping determine which solutions are most viable for large-scale implementation.

## **Project Assumptions**  

### **CO₂ Removal Estimates**  
- **Total CO₂ to be removed**: 140 gigatonnes (Gt).  
- **Current removal efforts**: 40 Gt.  
- **Remaining CO₂ gap**: 100 Gt.  

### **Cost Assumptions**  
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**: Estimated at **$150 per tonne** of CO₂.  
- **Nature-Based Removal**: Estimated at **$50 per tonne** of CO₂.  

### **Scalability Considerations**  
- **Nature-based solutions (forestation, soil sequestration)** are more affordable but require significant land use.  
- **DAC is scalable and technology-driven** but remains expensive and energy-intensive.  
- **A hybrid approach (DAC + soil carbon sequestration + enhanced weathering)** could balance cost and efficiency.

## **Key Insights from the Analysis**  

1. **The current pace of CO₂ removal is not enough** – At 40 Gt, active removal is far from the 140 Gt target.  
2. **Nature-based solutions are cheaper but have limits** – While they cost less, they require vast land areas and may not scale quickly.  
3. **Direct Air Capture (DAC) is scalable but expensive** – At $150 per tonne, DAC is currently one of the most viable long-term solutions, but costs must be reduced.  
4. **A mix of removal strategies is necessary** – No single solution can meet climate goals alone. Combining DAC, afforestation, and soil carbon sequestration may be the most effective approach.  
5. **Policy and investment decisions need real data** – Economic incentives will be required to make large-scale CO₂ removal feasible.
